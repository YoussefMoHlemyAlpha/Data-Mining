# Data Mining project
In this project, we will use unsupervised machine learning to categorize clients
based on features of their purchase behavior. Predictive marketing may help
businesses by finding clients that have similar demands or respond similarly to
marketing activity. We can also help businesses in determining suitable categories
to direct their targeted marketing campaigns.
Hunter's e-grocery is a well-known online shopping brand. Unexpected events such
as Covid-19, the Ukraine crisis, and the gas scarcity have all had an influence on
the purchasing behavior of clients. Therefore, using Clustering techniques and
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, we will
develop propositions for predictive marketing to target customers more accurately.
